Since livers are the main cause of human death you  commence upon the quest to help every human to de-liver their bodies.

Navigate your bar with W/A/S/D or a controller of your choice.

Seek out customers that want to order a tasty beverage.

(Slightly) bump into them to take their orders.

A maximum of 5 orders sound about right to remember in your absolutely normally functioning brain.

Get behind the counter to pour those drinks. And don't forget to get one for yourself!

After delivering the orders - yes, just bump into the customers again - feel the reward of love and kindness.

.. and cash. They should give you cash!

Try to keep on your feet until last call. Or don't... Who am I to tell you what to do?

Oh! If you ever feel thirsty, hit SPACE - or one of those buttons on your controller - to taste one of those drinks for your customers.

They won't be happy, but what is their appreciation compared to your buzz.

Now go and bring smiles into the world.

Seriously. Go!

I don't have anything else to tell you.

Go!

Press that start button down there!
