Since livers are the main cause of human death you  commence upon the quest to help every human to de-liver their bodies.

Navigate your bar with W/A/S/D or a controller of your choice

Seek out customers that want to order a tasty beverage.

(Slightly) bump into them to take their orders.

A maximum of 5 orders sound about right to remember in your absolutely normally functioning brain.

Get behind the bar to pour those drinks. And don't forget to get one for yourself.

After delivering the orders - yes, juts bump into the customers again - feel the reward of love and kindness

.. and cash. They should give you cash!

Try to keep upon your feed until last call. Or don't who am I to tell you what to do.

Oh! If you ever feel thirst, hit SPACE - or one of those buttons on your controller - to taste one of those drinks for your customers.

They won't be happy, but what is their apprechiation compared to your buzz.

Now go and bring smiles into the world.
